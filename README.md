## Content

This addon allows the user to throw grenades into armored vehicles with hatches. The interaction point is the main interaction point of the vehicle.

Multiple CBA settings for customization:
* **Allowed Grenades:** Allows the user to define which grenades can be used for the action.
* **Blacklist Vehicles (no inheritance):** Any vehicle in this list will not have the action enabled. It will only disable the vehicle itself and not its children (which means any classes that inherit from that class).
* **Blacklist Vehicles (with inheritance):** Any vehicle and their children in this list will not have the action enabled. You can use this setting to more easily blacklist a family of vehicles.
* **Damage dealt to units:** Allows the setting of the ACE damage applied to the crew of the target vehicle. The damage is applied randomly by both the function and the ACE damage function.
* **Damage dealt to hull:** Sets the amount of damage the hull will take from one grenade. This damage will be applied once and does not stack with any previous damage or future grenade in hatch damage.
* **Damage dealt to engine:** Sets the amount of damage the engine will take from one grenade. This damage will be applied once and does not stack with any previous damage or future grenade in hatch damage.
* **Damage dealt to turret:** Sets the amount of damage the turret will take from one grenade. This damage will be applied once and does not stack with any previous damage or future grenade in hatch damage.
* **Delay to explosion:** This is the time it will take for an explosion to occur after having successfully used the action.
* **Interaction time:** This is time it requires to perform a successful action.
